# Production Notes

## General
- Use minimal transitions — let shots breathe
- Consider consistent crossfades between films

## VO
- Record in 6 sections, export as WAV
- Edit out all breaths manually
- Apply light EQ + compression

## Post
- Add subtitles timed to each VO chunk
- Grade footage with muted contrast tones (avoid high saturation)

## Creative Goals
- Prioritize **emotional pacing over plot recap**
- Keep title overlays clean, serif, white — no animations
