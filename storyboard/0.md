<h1 align="center">0. TO DIE A GOOD MAN (0:00–1:15)</h1>

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

- **Total Duration:** 1:15
- **Function:** Establish tone and thesis — existential dread, fractured identity, and impossible moral choices.
- **Core Idea:** The unbearable cost of truth. Existential weight. Dread and disintegration. Memory as punishment. These films aren’t about twists — they’re about collapse.
- **Emotional Progression:** Unease → Recognition → Collapse
&nbsp;


## II. CORE THEME 
- **Thesis:** What do you do with a truth you can’t live with?
- **Framing:** Not “three films that end in a twist,” but three existential implosions framed as moral paradoxes.
- **Tone:** Lyrical, haunting, restrained.

## III. SCRIPT & VOICEOVER
> _“These are three very different films. Different directors. Different genres. Different continents.”_

> _“But the first time I watched each one — Oldboy, Shutter Island, The Dark Knight Rises — I left feeling the same thing.”_
>
> _“Like the ground had shifted under me. Like the ending had cracked something I didn’t know could break.”_

> _“Not because they were sad. Or violent. Or clever. But because they each left me asking the same question:”_
>
> _**“What the hell are you supposed to do with a truth you can’t live with?”**_

> _“In Oldboy, a man spends fifteen years obsessing over why he was imprisoned — only to realize the real punishment is finding out.”_
>
> _“In Shutter Island, a detective searches for a missing patient — only to discover the person who’s missing is himself.”_
>
> _“And in The Dark Knight Rises, a man tries to resurrect a myth — only to realize the myth has swallowed the man.”_

> _“Each story builds to a twist. But it’s not the kind you clap for. It’s the kind that sinks. That makes you rethink everything that came before.”_

> _“This video essay is about what happens when the truth doesn’t set you free. When justice is a myth. When memory becomes punishment. When the only choices left are delusion, disappearance… or destruction.”_

> _“Three films. Three impossible choices. One question that haunts all of them:”_
>
> _**“Is it better to die a good man… or to live as a monster?”**_

## IV. CLIP MAP & VISUAL STRUCTURE

### `0:00–0:20` — Opening Tableau: The Question

- **Visual:**  
  Fade in from black.  
  - *Shutter Island*: Teddy Daniels sits motionless on the asylum steps. His head is bowed. Fog drifts in behind him, slow and spectral.
  Cut to:
  - *Oldboy*: Oh Dae-su stumbles through snow, arms wrapped tightly around himself, blank-eyed.
  Cut to:
  - *The Dark Knight Rises*: Bruce Wayne climbs the prison wall, fingers bleeding on stone. Light spills from above, distant and unreachable.

- **Text Overlay:**
  Appears slowly across center frame, one line at a time:
  > _“Which would be worse:_  
  > _to live as a monster…_  
  > _or to die as a good man?”_ 
  Font: white serif (Garamond or Times New Roman), lightly kerned; centered.  
  Style: Line-by-line fade-in. Fades out before VO.

- **Tone:**  
  Cold. Meditative. Suspended dread. Each frame is motionless or near-frozen — not dramatic, but suspended, like time has stopped right before collapse.

- **Audio:**  
  A low ambient drone begins under black — barely audible at first.
  Wind swells subtly as the visuals begin.
  No music. No voiceover. Just the hush of an oncoming reckoning.
