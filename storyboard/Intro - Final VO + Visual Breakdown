0:20–1:15 — VOICEOVER BEGINS
"These are three very different films. Different directors. Different genres. Different continents."
"But the first time I watched each one — Oldboy, Shutter Island, The Dark Knight Rises — I left feeling the same thing."
"Like the ground had shifted under me. Like the ending had cracked something I didn’t know could break."
"Not because they were sad. Or violent. Or clever. But because they each left me asking the same question:"
“What the hell are you supposed to do with a truth you can’t live with?”

0:45–1:05 — MATCHED VO TO CLIPS (Visually Reinforce)

Clip: montage of Oh Dae-su shadowboxing in the cell → face at door slot → photo board reveal
"In Shutter Island, a detective searches for a missing patient — only to discover the person who’s missing is himself."
Clip: Teddy walking through Ward C → distorted mirror reflection → hallucination of wife
"And in The Dark Knight Rises, a man tries to resurrect a myth — only to realize the myth has swallowed the man."
Clip: Bruce standing in his manor in robe → looking at the Selina Kyle screen → limping through the cave

1:05–1:15 — VO FINISHES OVER INTERCUT CLIPS
"Each story builds to a twist. But it’s not the kind you clap for. It’s the kind that sinks. That makes you rethink everything that came before."
"This video essay is about what happens when the truth doesn’t set you free. When justice is a myth. When memory becomes punishment. When the only choices left are delusion, disappearance… or destruction."
"Three films. Three impossible choices. One question that haunts all of them:"
“Is it better to die a good man… or to live as a monster?”
