<h1 align="center">V. FINAL REFLECTION (13:00-14:30)</h1>

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

- **Total Duration:** ~1:30
- **Function:** Bring the essay full circle. Echo the opening question. Reframe the three character journeys as moral, not narrative, endings.
- **Core Idea:** These aren’t stories about heroes or villains. They’re meditations on survival, guilt, and the cost of memory.
- **Emotional Progression:** Reflection → Resonance → Open-ended closure
&nbsp;


## II. CORE THEME 
- **Thesis:**  These stories linger because they don’t resolve — they resonate. Each asks not how to win, but how to live with loss.
- **Framing:** The twist is not a gimmick — it’s a mirror. What you see in it says as much about you as it does about them.
- **Tone:** Philosophical. Ambiguous. Still haunted.

## III. SCRIPT & VOICEOVER
> “There’s a reason these stories resonate.”
> 
> “Because we all carry versions of ourselves we can’t face. Because we all wonder what it means to be good — and whether being good is even possible after certain lines are crossed.”
>
> “These films don’t give us clean answers. But they ask the hardest question a person can face: What do you do with a truth you can’t live with?”
>
> “Forget it? Disappear? Try to become someone new?”
>
> “Oldboy, Shutter Island, The Dark Knight Rises — they end not in triumph, but in the soft devastation of becoming someone you never intended to be.”
>
> “The twist isn’t the moment everything changes. It’s the moment you realize it already has.”
>
> “Three films. Three men. One question: Is it better to die a good man… or to live as a monster?”
