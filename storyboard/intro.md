## SECTION 1 -

`1:15-4:00`

# INTRO / HOOK (1:15-4:00)

---

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

- **Total Duration:** 2:45
- **Function:** Begin thematic unpacking — identity as confinement. Each character believes he’s pursuing truth, justice, or meaning. Instead, he is confronting himself.
- **Core Idea:** They aren’t chasing answers — they’re circling their own reflection.
- **Emotional Progression:** _Pursuit → Disorientation → Fracture_
&nbsp;

---

## II. CORE THEME

- **Thesis:** Identity isn’t a refuge — it’s the trap. These men are not freed by who they are, but imprisoned by it.
- **Framing:** These characters are trapped not just by institutions or enemies, but by their own memories, roles, and unresolved pasts. They are haunted by roles they can’t escape: the avenger, the lawman, the myth.
- **Tone:** Tension. Delusion. Rising dread.

## III. SCRIPT & VOICEOVER

> _“Each of these men is introduced to us as someone chasing answers — justice, revenge, a fugitive. But what they’re really chasing is themselves. And the closer they get, the more they unravel.”_
>
> _“In Oldboy, Oh Dae-su is stripped of memory, name, and agency. Fifteen years locked in a cell, with no explanation. When he emerges, he doesn’t just search for his captor — he searches for who he is now. And that search ends in horror. His entire identity has been constructed to lead him to ruin.”_
>
> _“In Shutter Island, Teddy Daniels is a U.S. Marshal investigating a missing patient. But he, too, is part of a psychological trap — except this one is self-inflicted. Teddy isn’t real. He’s Andrew Laeddis, a man who killed his wife after she drowned their children. The investigation is his coping mechanism.”_
>
> _“And in The Dark Knight Rises, Bruce Wayne isn’t quite alive. He’s a ghost haunting his own mansion, clinging to the Batman myth as a reason to exist. But that myth has long stopped serving Gotham — it only serves his pain.”_
>
> _**“These aren’t just characters with alter-egos. They are men imprisoned by identity itself.”**_
