### <ins>`0:00–0:12`</ins> — The Descent into Stillness

---

#### 🎬 Visuals  
**Begin on black. Fade in slowly:**

- **_Shutter Island_** → Teddy Daniels sits motionless on the stone steps outside Ashecliffe Hospital.  
  His head is bowed, unmoving. Fog drifts behind him — not fast, but slow and heavy, like memory.  
  ⏱️ *Clip: 1:44:05–1:44:10*

  > “The world feels emptied out — whatever broke him already happened.”  
  > “He’s not recovering from trauma — he’s suspended in it. Stillness becomes the scene’s gravity.”

**Cut to:**

- **_Oldboy_** → Oh Dae-su staggers through a whitewashed snowscape.  
  Arms wrapped tightly around himself. His expression is blank. He doesn’t brace for cold — he braces against knowing.  
  ⏱️ *Clip: 1:47:22–1:47:28*

  > “The whiteout isn’t just weather — it’s psychic exile. He’s walking through absence.”

#### ✍️ Text Overlay  
> _“Which would be worse:_  
> _to live as a monster…”_

- **Font:** White serif (Times or Garamond), large, centered  
- **Style:** Line-by-line fade-in (Line 1 on Teddy, Line 2 on Dae-su)  
- **Timing:** Each line held ~2 seconds, full fade-out before 0:12  
- **Accessibility Tip:** Add subtle drop shadow for visibility over fog/snow

#### 🎧 Audio  
- Low ambient drone begins under black  
- Wind texture fades in during snow shot  
- No dialogue, no score — let silence speak

---

#### 🧠 Editorial Notes  
- Shots must feel suspended in time — no urgency  
- Crossfade softly (~0.75s) between Teddy and Dae-su  
- Don’t cut away too soon — hold until discomfort arrives  
- Use silence as an emotional pressure point, not just absence of sound
