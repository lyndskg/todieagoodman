<h1 align="center">IV. THEIR FINAL CHOICE (10:00-13:00)</h1>

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

- **Total Duration:** 3:00
- **Function:** Present each protagonist’s final decision — not a plot resolution, but a moral reckoning.
- **Core Idea:** Each man chooses how to live with the unbearable. None escape unscathed — but all choose a kind of death.
- **Emotional Progression:** Collapse → Confrontation → Decision
&nbsp;


## II. CORE THEME 
- **Thesis:** When redemption is impossible, you don’t choose what’s right — you choose what you can survive.
- **Framing:** These are not victories. They’re acts of surrender. But in surrender, there’s something deeply human — even sacred.
- **Tone:** Quiet. Resigned. Profound.
&nbsp;


## III. SCRIPT & VOICEOVER
> “In the end, they all face the same choice: live as a monster, or die as a good man.”
“Oh Dae-su begs to forget. He willingly chooses hypnosis, pleading to have the truth stripped from him. He cannot live with what he knows.”
“Teddy Daniels submits to the lobotomy. Maybe he relapsed. Maybe he faked it. Either way, he chooses death of the self.”
“Bruce Wayne chooses life. But not as Batman. He lets the city believe he’s dead, kills the myth, and escapes to Italy — not as a hero, but as a man finally free of his pain.”
“Each makes a different choice. But all are answers to the same question.”

## V. AUDIO DESIGN
- Sparse: ambient wind, creaking wood, trailing piano lines
Echoes of key dialogue lines return subtly (“die a good man…”, “you’re not Batman anymore…”, “why did you imprison me?”)
Fades to silence by 13:00 mark — a full emotional stop
