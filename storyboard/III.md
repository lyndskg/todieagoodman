<h1 align="center">III. JUSTICE, VENGEANCE, & THE ILLUSION OF REDEMPTION (7:00-10:00)</h1>

## I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

- **Total Duration:** 3:00
- **Function:** Unpack the ethical collapse at the heart of each story — the pursuit of justice is revealed to be a coping mechanism or delusion.
- **Core Idea:** What these men call justice is often vengeance — or worse, self-preservation disguised as virtue.
- **Emotional Progression:** Conviction → Disillusionment → Abandonment
&nbsp;


## II. CORE THEME 
- **Thesis:** Justice in these films is performative. It’s a mask worn to conceal brokenness — or to justify it.
- **Framing:** Each protagonist believes he’s restoring order. In reality, he’s avoiding personal collapse.
- **Tone:** Sardonic. Tragic. Morally ambiguous.

## III. SCRIPT & VOICEOVER
> “Justice, in these stories, is a mirage.”
“Oh Dae-su wants revenge. But revenge is not justice — it’s just another cage. His obsession blinds him to the fact that he’s being manipulated again, pulled by strings he can’t see.”
“Teddy Daniels believes he’s solving a crime. But his investigation is a smokescreen. He invents a conspiracy so he doesn’t have to admit he is the monster he’s hunting.”
“Bruce Wayne believes in saving Gotham. But he can’t do it as himself. Not anymore. He must become myth. And then, eventually, he must kill the myth.”
“Each man thinks he’s pursuing justice. But all of them are just trying to survive what they’ve done.”
