STORYBOARD — INTRO (0:00–1:15) — TO DIE A GOOD MAN

I. STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW
Total Duration: 1:15
Function: Establish tone and thesis — existential dread, fractured identity, and impossible moral choices.
Core Idea: The unbearable cost of truth. Existential weight. Dread and disintegration. Memory as punishment. These films aren’t about twists — they’re about collapse.
Emotional Progression: Unease → Recognition → Collapse

II. CORE THEME
Thesis: What do you do with a truth you can’t live with?
Framing: Not “three films that end in a twist,” but three existential implosions framed as moral paradoxes.
Tone: Lyrical, haunting, restrained.

III. SCRIPT & VOICEOVER
“These are three very different films. Different directors. Different genres. Different continents.”
“But the first time I watched each one — Oldboy, Shutter Island, The Dark Knight Rises — I left feeling the same thing.”
“Like the ground had shifted under me. Like the ending had cracked something I didn’t know could break.”
“Not because they were sad. Or violent. Or clever. But because they each left me asking the same question:”
“What the hell are you supposed to do with a truth you can’t live with?”
“In Oldboy, a man spends fifteen years obsessing over why he was imprisoned — only to realize the real punishment is finding out.”
“In Shutter Island, a detective searches for a missing patient — only to discover the person who’s missing is himself.”
“And in The Dark Knight Rises, a man tries to resurrect a myth — only to realize the myth has swallowed the man.”
“Each story builds to a twist. But it’s not the kind you clap for. It’s the kind that sinks. That makes you rethink everything that came before.”
“This video essay is about what happens when the truth doesn’t set you free. When justice is a myth. When memory becomes punishment. When the only choices left are delusion, disappearance… or destruction.”
“Three films. Three impossible choices. One question that haunts all of them:”
“Is it better to die a good man… or to live as a monster?”
